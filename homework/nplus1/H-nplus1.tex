\section*{$(n+1)$-st Homework Assignment}

{\bf{Due Date}}: The day after of final exam meeting period.\\

This is your final assignment for CSCI 432.

Write a two-page paper describing to me how you have grown as a student,
computer scientist, mathematician, engineer, or a researcher in this class, and
more generally, in this semester.  To support your argument, you should include
your homework or writing samples (or excerpts from them) in an appendix as
evidence (and reference them!)

If you do not feel that you've grown, explain why.

Remember, style counts. Use complete sentences.
