\nextprob{Self-Assessment}

The prerequisites for this class are Discrete Structures (CSCI 246) and Data
Structures and Algorithms (CSCI 232). Reflect on your in-class self-assessment
``quiz'' and briefly discuss here any weaknesses you can identify in your
prerequisite knowledge.  It is suggested to look at the course descriptions
and/or course syllabi for these courses for a deeper reflection. If you do not
identify any weaknesses, state so and reflect on what you plan to work on during
this semester in order to strengthen your skills.
